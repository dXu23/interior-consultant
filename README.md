## Overview

![screenshot](./interior.png)

Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- Where can I see your demo?

Right [here](https://stirring-conkies-c6dae4.netlify.app/)

- What was your experience?

This was a pretty hard challenge because I wasn't sure from the beginning how to
implement the mobile navigation menu.

- What have you learned/improved?

I learned how to use absolute and relative positioning to overlay a div over an image,
as well as about CSS animations.

- Your wisdom? :)

### Built With

Just HTML, CSS, and JS.
