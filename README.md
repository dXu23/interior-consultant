## Overview

Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- Where can I see your demo?

Right [here](https://coldfix.dev/dev-challenges/interior-consultant/interior.html)

- What was your experience?

This was a pretty hard challenge because I wasn't sure from the beginning how to
implement the mobile navigation menu. 

- What have you learned/improved?

I learned how to use absolute and relative positioning to overlay a div over an image,
as well as about CSS animations.

- Your wisdom? :)
